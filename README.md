# UAP_SIGTHINGS

Since the recent trends and uproar with UFO/UAP (Unidentified Flying Object) and (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) having it a lot of attention in the internet, social media, t.v. international/local news, and 1st-world countries especially in the United States of America Government and Congress, (NASA) National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and all over the world that they even made a UAP disclosure and amendment https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/uap_amendment.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2Imczol7KB_46DL7nxJsIMMWIoeunLtfAIIbX894aHdujkV0uP-Auv13A in the United States of America Democratic Senate Government, We have made a project: A website and database that currently stores over 2 million events & information about UFO/UAP sightings going back to year 0100, 1st century with the legitimate sources from (NUFORC) National UFO Reporting Center, (MUFON)
Mutual UFO Network, (NICAP) National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena,
nationalarchives.gov, US National Intelligence office, etc. The database was built using TiDB Serverless Tier, TIDB version v6.6.0, Cloud Provider AWS, Region Frankfurt(eu-central-1) , which is an advanced, open-source, distributed SQL database with MySQL, Rails, Python, JBDC, Go, and Node.js, etc. compatibility. We use this TIDB database to build a web application with Vercel that allows users to report sightings of UFO/UAPs and view its image with SDXL 0.9, short for for Stable Diffusion XL. The application will also includes features in the future such as a map that shows the location of sightings and a search function that allows users to filter sightings based on various criteria.

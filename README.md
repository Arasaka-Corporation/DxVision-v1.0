# UAP_SIGTHINGS
Since the recent trends and uproar with UFO/UAP and it having a lot of attention especially in the USA government, NASA, and all over the world I have made a project idea: creating a database that stores information about UFO/UAP sightings. The database can be built using TiDB, which is an advanced, open-source, distributed SQL database with MySQL compatibility. You can then use this database to build a web application that allows users to report sightings of UFO/UAPs. The application can also include features such as a map that shows the location of sightings and a search function that allows users to filter sightings based on various criteria.

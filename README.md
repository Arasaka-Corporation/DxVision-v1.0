The database was built using TiDB Serverless Tier, TIDB version v6.6.0, Cloud Provider AWS, Region Frankfurt(eu-central-1) , which is an advanced, open-source, distributed SQL database with MySQL, Rails, Python, JBDC, Go, and Node.js, etc. compatibility. We use this TIDB database to build a web application with Vercel that allows users to report sightings of UFO/UAPs and generate & view its image with SDXL 0.9, short for for Stable Diffusion XL. The application will also includes features in the future such as a map that shows the location of sightings and a search function that allows users to filter sightings based on various criteria.

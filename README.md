# UAP_SIGTHINGS

Since the recent trends and uproar with UFO/UAP (Unidentified Flying Object) and (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) having it a lot of attention in social media and news and countries especially in the United States of America government and congress, NASA, and all over the world that they even made a UAP amendment in the United States of America senate, I have made a project: creating a website and database that stores information about UFO/UAP sightings. The database was built using TiDB Serverless Tier, TIDB version v6.6.0, Cloud Provider AWS, Region Frankfurt(eu-central-1) , which is an advanced, open-source, distributed SQL database with MySQL, Rails, Python, JBDC, Go, and Node.js, etc. compatibility. We use this TIDB database to build a web application with Vercel that allows users to report sightings of UFO/UAPs and view its image with Bing AI Image Generator and Dall-E 2. The application also includes features such as a map that shows the location of sightings and a search function that allows users to filter sightings based on various criteria.
